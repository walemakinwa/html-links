        December 8, 2020.
        
        Mr. Ademola Fazaz,
        15B, Georgious Cole, Street,
        Ifako Ogba Lagos.
        
        Dear Sir,
        OUTSTANDING RENTS ON TWO (2) BEDROOM RIGHT WING FLAT BEHIND 
        METHODIST CHURCH KUKUMADA IBADAN, OYO-STATE.
        We are constrained to write this letter to you after our several verbal discussions failed to yield the expected positive results. Please be reminded that your tenancy in this property expired with effluxion of time since Monday, August 31, 2020.
        Kindly be reminded also that we are all effected by the after effects of Covid 19 pandemic one way or the other, and that your landlord is unfortunately in a similar situation with you or even  worse position with many friends and relatives he have to help out in this period within his limited resources.
        Hence he has directed us to inform you that he has a major challenge of servicing his mortgage on the property now more than ever before.
        In addition, he asked us to reiterate his expression of displeasure at your undue delay of payments of rents. 
        He further directs that we should reiterate that he cherishes performance of obligations as and at when due.
        We think it is fair enough that your landlord waived his original plans to review your rent upward and also waited this far for you to pay your outstanding rents.
        In line with the above, we implore you to kindly effect payment of your outstanding rents in the sum of N1,000,000:00 (One  Million Naira) only for the tenancy period, September 1, 2020 to August 31, 2021 into our A. Ademakinwa & Co. GTB account number 000257566 on or before December 14, 2020 without fail.
        Thank you.
        Yours faithfully, 
        For: A.Ademakinwa & Co.,
         
        Kehinde Ademakinwa.
